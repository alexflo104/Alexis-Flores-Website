        <p>Hello, my name is Alexis Flores and I recently graduated from the University of Houston - Clear Lake with a Bachelors Degree of Science in Computer Information Systems.    
            I have interned for AtLink Communication as a IT Intern where i got hands on experience in the IT Helpdesk field.
            AtLink primarily worked with health care companies around the Clear Lake and Bayarea areas of Houston.
            Here I learned important skills about active directories, Office 365, and troubleshooting software issues.
            I have also been helping my Dad run a yard maintance business since I was in sophmore high school where I learned the importance of service jobs and customer service.
            I created this personal website in order to show my skills for employment but as well as a record of how I hopefully have grown over the years.
            <br><br>
            Thank you, 
            <br>
