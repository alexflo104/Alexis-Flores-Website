                    <a class="about-me">Hello, my name is Alexis Flores and I recently graduated from the University of Houston - Clear Lake with a Bachelors Degree of Science in Computer Information Systems.    
                        I have interned for AtLink Communication as a IT Intern where i got hands on experience in the IT Helpdesk field.
                        AtLink primarily worked with health care companies around the Clear Lake and Bayarea areas of Houston.
                        <br><br>
                        Here I learned important skills about active directories, Office 365, and troubleshooting software issues.
                        I have also been helping my Dad run a yard maintance business since I was in sophmore high school where I learned the importance of service jobs and customer service.
                        I created this personal website in order to show my skills for employment but as well as a record of how I hopefully have grown over the years.
                        <br><br>
                        Thank you, 
                        <br>

                    <p>This is a work in progress project where I am using Data Analysis tools to examine and find answers from video game sales.
                        I am looking at video game sales from the PS4 and Xbox since these are the latest consoles that have finished their lifecycle.</p>
